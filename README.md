Provide a sample Cosmos smart contract that can do the following:
- Starting with a specific token, perform a swap on a DEX (e.g. Osmosis) and then bridge the resulting tokens to another chain using a bridge (e.g. Gravity).
- This must all be done in a single transaction.

Describe how your example can be scaled to handle multiple chains (e.g. more than 2 steps).
