Provide a sample Cosmos smart contract that can do the following:
- Starting with a specific token, perform a swap on a DEX (e.g. Osmosis) and then bridge the resulting tokens to another chain using a bridge (e.g. Gravity).
- This must all be done in a single transaction.

Describe how your example can be scaled to handle multiple chains (e.g. more than 2 steps).
1. divide the contract logic into separate modules, each for a particular DEX, bridge, or chain. 
2. message passing between different modules within the contract, where each module can process its respective step and pass the result to the other module.
3. add error handling, input validation, and provide appropriate error messages for each step.
4. manage state and dependencies with using storage facilities like singletons or multistore (here can be implemented other patterns).
5. use separate modules or extensions for each chain, which should encapsulate the specific logic and integration details required to interact with the specific dex, bridge, or chain.
